Hey! I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that actually make a difference. I work on both web and mobile stuff, and I enjoy jumping between frontend and backendâ€”whether it's making a slick UI or setting up a solid backend system. Lately, I've been diving into everything from DevOps to AI agents. I'm always experimenting with new tools, building projects, and sharing what I learn along the way. Basically, if there's an idea worth building, I'm all in.
        </p>

        {/* <p>
          Whether it's a mobile app for iOS and Android or a powerful web
          platform, I focus on clean code, great user experience, and seamless
          functionality. My work helps businesses and individuals bring their
          ideas to life through technology.
